                CODE BREAKDOWN

                First, html style the page to have a heading at the top in jumbotron from bootstrap
                            MAKE SURE TO HAVE BOOTSTRAP LINK

                
                Type out "STAR WARS TRIVIA" at the top, h1

                Start javascript

                        create an array(word1, word2, ect) for each item containing the letters needed to be guessed

                        First, create a loop that attaches the blank for each space in the playing area and add one to a (scoreNeeded) var, 
                        it will have an embedded if statement that will do nothing if it is a space in the word

                        when the user hits a key, there will be a for loop that will check the var (userGuess) with a keyboard against every in the array 
                        
                        if it matches, 
                        the letter will overwrite the blank space given to it and added one to a (userScore) var that will track the players progress

                        if it does not match, the letter will be assigned and attached to section that shows all unmatched blocks
                        (userTick) will be decreased by 1, if this reaches 0, game over



                        if (userScore)=(scoreNeeded), player gets a var (wins) tracker of + 1
